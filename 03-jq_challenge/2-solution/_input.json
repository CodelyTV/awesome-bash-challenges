👋 Qué surpresa tan buena encontrar que a ustedes les gusta Zim y lo utilizan en su dotfiles y su curso de Zsh!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSee changelog in https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for chosing Zim as the Zsh framework of choice for your dotfiles and your courses!\r\n\r\nI spotted a few points where the usage is not compatible with the changes since Zim 1.0.0 (released 2020-01-07):\r\n* The zimfw repo is not intended to be cloned for daily use. You only need the zimfw.zsh file. And downloading it from https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw/releases/latest/download/zimfw.zsh will always give you the latest released version of it.\r\n* .zimrc should only contain module definitions, and it's not sourced anymore when the shell starts.\r\n* `zhighlighters` is deprecated in favor of `ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_HIGHLIGHTERS`, since we're using the zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting module directly now.\r\n* There are two separate zimfw actions: `upgrade` will upgrade the zimfw.zsh file itself, and `update` will update the modules. You usually would want to do both if you want to \"up\" everything...\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-11T00:07:36Z","updated_at":"2021-11-12T16:07:00Z","closed_at":"2021-11-12T16:06:44Z","merged_at":"2021-11-12T16:06:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"28a83eb17bf3cc972fbe271de60446ad81ccd3b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CodelyTV/dotly/pulls/192/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CodelyTV/dotly/pulls/192/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CodelyTV/dotly/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CodelyTV/dotly/issues/192/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CodelyTV/dotly/statuses/fd1df517991c1c27abd37f566c39c0d9dc34407b","head":{"label":"ericbn:zim","ref":"zim","sha":"fd1df517991c1c27abd37f566c39c0d9dc34407b","user":{"login":"ericbn","id":4120606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjA2MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4120606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbn","html_url":"https://github.com/ericbn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":426816418,"node_id":"R_kgDOGXCzog","name":"dotly","full_name":"ericbn/dotly","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ericbn","id":4120606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjA2MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4120606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbn","html_url":"https://github.com/ericbn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ericbn/dotly","description":"🌚
